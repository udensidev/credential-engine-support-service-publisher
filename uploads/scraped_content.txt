Our transformative learning experiences, in and out of the classroom, are designed to produce alumni who desire to make a significant, societal impact. Links to Illinois Facts 1867 Year Founded 29 Pulitzer Prizes Invented the first graphical web browser #9 Ranked Public University 56,000+ Students from all 50 states and 100+ countries Mission The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is charged by our state to enhance the lives of citizens in Illinois, across the nation and around the world through our leadership in learning, discovery, engagement and economic development. Vision We will be the pre-eminent* public research university with a land-grant mission and global impact. Campus Profile Since its founding in 1867, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has earned a reputation as a world-class leader in research, teaching, and public engagement. Faculty A talented and highly respected faculty is the university’s most significant resource. Many are recognized for exceptional scholarship with memberships in such organizations as the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Sciences, and the National Academy of Engineering. Our faculty have been awarded Nobel Prizes, Pulitzer Prizes, and the Fields Medal in Mathematics. The success of our faculty is matched by that of our alumni: 11 are Nobel Laureates and another 18 have won Pulitzer Prizes. Academic Resources Academic resources on campus are among the finest in the world. The University Library is one of the largest public university collections in the world with 15 million volumes in its 20+ unit libraries. Annually, 53,000,000 people visit its online catalog. Students have access to thousands of computer terminals in classrooms, residence halls, and campus libraries for use in classroom instruction, study, and research. Research At Illinois, our focus on research shapes our identity, permeates our classrooms and fuels our outreach. Fostering discovery and innovation is our fundamental mission. As a public, land-grant university, we have the responsibility to create new knowledge and new ideas and translate these into better ways of working, living and learning for our state, nation and world. Entrepreneurship flows from the classrooms to Research Park, a space that houses everything from Fortune 500 companies to student-founded startups. We are consistently ranked among the top five universities for NSF-funded research and our total annual research funding exceeds $600 million. The Arts A major center for the arts, the campus attracts dozens of nationally and internationally renowned artists each year to its widely acclaimed Krannert Center for the Performing Arts. The University also supports two major museums: the Krannert Art Museum and Kinkead Pavilion; and the Spurlock Museum, a museum of world history and culture. Other major facilities include the multipurpose State Farm Center (16,500 seats); Memorial Stadium (70,000 seats), site of Big Ten Conference football games; and the Activities and Recreation Center (ARC), one of the largest recreational facilities of its kind on a university campus. Undergraduate Education The fundamental promise at Illinois for nearly 150 years has been to provide our undergraduate students with truly transformative educational experiences. Whether these experiences take place in the classroom, in the surrounding community or around the globe, our students leave this campus with the skills, knowledge and the drive to become leaders in their fields and to lead lives of impact in the world. Each year we welcome more than 32,000 undergraduate students across our nine undergraduate divisions – offering nearly 5,000 courses in more than 150 fields of study and awarding about 7,000 new degrees each spring. Pre-eminence *This is how the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign defines pre-eminence: We will be the best at what we do; this is a matter of excellence in achievement. We will have impact locally, nationally and globally through transformational learning experiences and groundbreaking scholarship. We will be recognized by our peers as leaders. We will be visible to the nation and world – this is the leadership expected from a world-class university with a land-grant mission.

Below are several examples of the historical accomplishments of our university. Learn more about these, and others, by visiting the Historical Markers found across the campus. Disability Resources and Education Founded in 1948 by Dr. Tim Nugent, the Division of Disability Resources and Educational Services (DRES) was the first post secondary disability support service program in the world. DRES began as a result of Dr. Nugent’s unyielding belief that veterans injured in WWII should nevertheless be able to take advantage of the GI bill and attend college. From those early days came more than 60 years of breakthroughs and “firsts” in accessibility that include everything from wheelchair athletics to buses with wheelchair lifts to curb cuts in our streets and sidewalks. The Father of Physical Fitness In 1944, Thomas K. Cureton became the director of the physical fitness research laboratory, one of the first of its kind in the nation. He developed methods to test motor and cardiovascular fitness and aquatic performance and to appraise the human physique. Cureton played a major role in the development of the fitness movement in America. Modern Pork Industry In 1950, Gene Becker accepted a position on the Illinois faculty and began research on the diet for swine.  His findings were revolutionary and put him at odds with the established swine industry.  Becker concluded that adding animal protein and so-called “unidentified growth factors” to feed was unnecessary. In fact, he said, there was “no such thing as unidentified growth factors.” Soon Becker's economical corn-soybean meal diet for swine, which combined corn, soybean-meal, vitamins and minerals, was adopted worldwide. PLATO In 1960, electrical engineering professor Donald Bitzer and physics professor Chalmers Sherwin developed PLATO, the Programmed Logic Automated Teaching Operation. PLATO was the world’s first shared computer-based education system. It included direct instruction, research, and global communication in several different languages.  It featured the first on-line community and first e-mail program.  PLATO was stocked with so many innovations it was soon used on five continents and at institutions across the U-S. Special Education In the late 1950s, Samuel A. Kirk established the Institute for Research on Exceptional Children, the first multi-disciplinary research unit of its kind in the world. Kirk’s research and his development of the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities led to the concept of “learning disabilities” and to new techniques of remedial education. Thanks to the early work of Kirk and his colleagues – special education was born and huge steps were taken in ensuring that everyone should have the chance to learn. LED Nick Holonyak was the first graduate student under the guidance of two-time Nobel Prize winner John Bardeen, and joined the Illinois faculty in 1963. Holonyak's accomplishments have changed the world. He introduced the quantum-well laser and invented the first practical light-emitting-diode.  Today, all L-E-Ds and lasers use Holonyak’s quantum well lasers. Holonyak is one of a handful of people who have won both the National Medal of Science and the National Medal of Technology. Third Main Branch of the ‘Tree of Life’ In 1977, Carl Woese revolutionized molecular biology when he announced that life came in three forms, not two.  Previously, it was thought that the “tree of life” consisted of two main branches – bacteria, and everything else. Woese discovered the third branch, which he named Archaea.  His many awards including the National Medal of Science, the Crafoord Prize in Biosciences given by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and a MacArthur Foundation ‘genius’ grant. First Graphical Web Browser As an Illinois student, Marc Andreessen landed a job as a student-programmer at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. There he teamed with staff member Eric Bina, and together they created the prototype for Mosaic, the first browser for the World Wide Web, in 1993. Mosaic was credited with enabling the Web to gain widespread popularity. It was called the first "killer application." Soon after graduating from Illinois, Andreessen met Jim Clark from Silicon Graphics who was interested in starting a new company. Andreessen, Clark, and Bina founded Netscape in 1994. For several years, it was the dominant web browser. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Paul C. Lauterbur received the 2003 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine. The prize recognized his development of Magnetic Resonance Imaging, which led to the invention of the medical MRI, a device that has become invaluable to the medical field.

Listed below are the most common sources of funding. For additional details, visit “ Funding Graduate School ” in our GradLIFE blog. Assistantships Assistantships entail performing work in exchange for a stipend. Assistantships are provided in terms of percentage of full-time effort (“FTE”), and they range from 1% to 100% FTE, with the most common being 50% FTE (20 hours/week).  Tuition waivers are generally provided for assistantships that are between 25% and 67% FTE. There are four kinds of assistantships: Teaching Assistantships - TAs provide instruction, either by teaching their own classes or helping professors teach classes. Research Assistantships - RAs help professors conduct research and are usually paid through a professor’s grant. Graduate Assistantships - GAs usually perform administrative duties to assist a particular department or administrative office. Pre-Professional Graduate Assistantships - PGA duties allow students to gain experience closely related to their field of study and career preparation. Most assistantships are awarded through your home department. The Assistantship Clearinghouse lists some additional assistantship opportunities. Learn more about assistantships . Fellowships Fellowships are competitively awarded funding packages that officially do not require work in exchange for a stipend. Instead, fellowships generally allow the awardee the freedom to devote 100% of his/her time to research and coursework. Fellowships usually pay a generous stipend, and if that stipend is $10,000 or greater, the awardee may become eligible for a tuition waiver (waivers are not available to students in cost-recovery and self-supporting programs). Fellowships are divided into two categories, depending on their source: Internal fellowships are those that are provided by a unit on campus such as a department, a research center, the Graduate College, etc.  Some units advertise their fellowships on their websites. For details, students should contact the units directly. External fellowships are provided by a source external to campus, e.g., a private foundation, corporation, governmental agency, professional association, etc.  External fellowships usually carry significant prestige, and the Graduate College houses an office dedicated to helping Illinois graduate students compete for these awards. Visit the Office of External Fellowships for details. One key resource offered by this office is the Fellowship Finder database , one of the nation’s most comprehensive and current list of fellowships and grants for graduate students. Learn more about fellowships . Extracurricular Employment Some students may wish to work in more traditional positions either on campus or off campus. See the listing of campus job boards . Loans Private loans and unsubsidized federal loans are available to graduate students. Students pursuing loans should consult with the Office of Student Financial Aid . Learn more about student loans .

What is Illinois Honors? At Illinois, we offer honors options of several kinds: support for students applying for nationally competitive scholarships; honors work in academic departments; the college-wide James Scholar honors programs; and the community of "Chancellor's Scholars" in the Campus Honors Program. Because graduation requirements for these programs often overlap, it's possible to complete more than one without a great deal of additional course work. Every year, many Illinois students graduate with several kinds of academic distinction. What's Special About Illinois Honors? College students can excel in different ways. Sometimes their special strengths and enthusiasms are brought to life when they find a major. Other students thrive in interdisciplinary seminars and co-curricular activities; in interactions and friendships with distinguished scholars and scientists; in adventurous and intellectually challenging experience abroad; or in independent research, leadership, and service. It's not unusual for Illinois students to reach their own academic "high gear" later than their first semester. Young people on our campus change, and as a cooperating confederation of programs, Illinois Honors can be there for you when you're ready for honors-level work. Your Freshman Honors Experience When you are admitted as a James Scholar or Chancellor's Scholar, your first year will include special opportunities and events with the following objectives: To help build friendships with other students who share a special interest in intellectual adventure and professional growth; To introduce the vast variety of resources and events at Illinois, the worlds of learning and culture just beyond the classroom door. Beyond the Freshman Year The university promotes and supports students applying for nationally competitive awards. The National and International Scholarships Program challenges aspiring scholars to make the most of their time at Illinois and assists applicants for awards such as the Fulbright, Rhodes, and Truman Scholarships in sharing their profiles with selection committees. For further information about these opportunities, please visit the National and International Scholarships Program website . When you continue as a James Scholar or Chancellor's Scholar, you can expect to participate in honors seminars or research experiences offered by your chosen major department or your college.
        Some of these programs offer study abroad options and numerous co-curricular activities, or internships and field experiences for professional development. Honor Societies The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign recognizes more than 50 independent honor societies. Among the prestigious national honor societies with campus chapters at Illinois are Tau Beta Pi (Engineering), Beta Gamma Sigma (Business), Kappa Delta Pi (Education), Phi Beta Kappa (LAS), Phi Kappa Phi (campus-wide), and the freshman honor societies Alpha Lambda Delta, Gamma Sigma Delta (ACES), and Phi Eta Sigma. Membership in these societies is usually decided in your junior or senior year. For more information, confer with the local representative of the society that offers membership to you, or consult with a dean or academic advisor in your departmental or college office. Dean's List For each fall and spring semester, a Dean's List is compiled and published by each college, recognizing students who have completed on campus a full course-load of traditionally-graded semester-hours, achieving at least a "B" average for that term, and ranking in the top 20% of the class. Additional criteria are established by each college. Honors Upon Graduation Qualifying seniors are eligible for recognition based upon scholastic merit. Cum Laude, Magna Cum Laude, and Summa Cum Laude are citations conferred by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences for high grade-point averages and completion of an intellectually-challenging curriculum.
        Honors, High Honors, and Highest Honors are distinctions conferred by the following University of Illinois colleges: Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences, Applied Life Studies, Business, Media, Engineering, Education, and Fine and Applied Arts. Qualifications for Cum Laude, Honors and higher designations are determined by each college. Also conferred in spring semester, Bronze Tablet honors the top 3% of graduates from each college.
        These students receive special recognition and regalia at graduation ceremonies, and their names are inscribed on the tablets in the first-floor corridors of the University Library.
        In addition, many Illinois academic departments award Distinction, High Distinction, or Highest Distinction for the completion of honors-quality work as specified in these curricula.

More News Events Date Event 5.9.2025 Final Exams (May 9-15) (?) 5.17.2025 Campus-wide Commencement Day (?) Online Illinois Calendar Blogs Refresher Tips for Online Students | 2.19.2025 By. Laura Woo, Marketing Intern Succeeding in an online course isn’t just about completing assignments — it requires strong study habits, time management, and staying engaged. Without the structure of in-person classes, it’s easy to lose focus, but small adjustments can make a big difference. Whether you’re new to online learning or just need a reset, these practical tips will help you stay organized, motivated, and on track. 1. Establish a Routine That Works for You One of the biggest advantages of online learning is flexibility, but that also means you’re responsible for managing your own schedule. Set dedicated time blocks for watching lectures, completing readings, and working on assignments. Treat these study sessions like real class meetings—consistent effort will prevent last-minute stress. 2. Create a Distraction-Free Study Space Your environment plays a major role in your ability to focus. Whether it’s a quiet corner in your home, a local library, or a coworking space, find a place where you can work without distractions. Keep essential materials within reach and eliminate digital interruptions by silencing notifications while studying. 3. Stay Engaged in Your Courses Online classes can sometimes feel isolating, so make an effort to engage with the material and your classmates. Participate in discussion boards, ask questions during virtual office hours, and take advantage of group projects to build connections. The more involved you are, the more rewarding your learning experience will be. 4. Use a Planner or Digital Calendar With multiple deadlines across different courses, it’s crucial to stay organized. Use a planner, digital calendar, or task management app to track assignments, exams, and important dates. Setting reminders for deadlines can help you stay on top of your workload without feeling overwhelmed. 5. Communicate with Your Professors Your instructors want you to succeed, but they won’t know if you’re struggling unless you reach out. If you have questions about assignments, need extra clarification, or face any challenges, don’t hesitate to email your professor or attend virtual office hours. Proactive communication can make a big difference in your academic success. 6. Take Breaks and Prioritize Self-Care Studying for long hours without breaks can lead to burnout. Incorporate short breaks into your schedule to rest and recharge. Activities like stretching, taking a walk, or even stepping away for a few minutes can improve focus and productivity. Also, ensure you’re getting enough sleep, eating well, and maintaining a balance between school and personal life. 7. Use Available Academic Resources Many universities offer support services specifically for online students. Take advantage of virtual libraries, tutoring services, writing centers, and career counseling. These resources are designed to help you succeed, so don’t hesitate to use them when needed. By implementing these strategies, you can navigate the challenges of online education with confidence and stay on track toward achieving your academic goals. Stay motivated, stay focused, and make the most of your online learning experience! You’ve got this!

Balancing year-end deadlines with holiday cheer | 11.11.2024 The holiday season brings both excitement and challenges, especially for busy professionals in graduate programs. From finalizing work projects to wrapping up semester assignments—not to mention holiday planning—it’s easy to feel pulled in multiple directions. Here are some time management strategies to help you stay on track you’re your goals and meet deadlines while also enjoying the festivities. Prioritize Tasks by Impact and Deadline Start by listing all of your end-of-year deadlines, including work projects, assignments and personal to-dos. Rank each task by deadline and impact to prioritize your list and determine what must be done first. Prioritizing allows you to see where your time is most effectively spent. Hopefully, this helps you avoid last-minute stress, so that you can not only attend but also enjoy your holiday events. Time Block Your Calendar—and Stick to It Use time-blocking to designate periods for focused work, coursework, and holiday preparation. If it helps, set alarms for each block to help with transitions. Blocking out time keeps you accountable and prevents work or study tasks from spilling into personal time. Take Advantage of Flexible Study Hours to Get Ahead One of the perks of online graduate programs is the flexibility to study around your schedule. Use this to your advantage by working ahead on assignments when you have free time. You may even try dedicating part of a weekend morning to study time to free up time later in the week. By front-loading some of your coursework, you can start the holidays with a lighter load, giving you more time to enjoy the season. Set Boundaries and Say No (Politely) Your social invitations and family gatherings may already be stacking up and leaving you feeling overwhelmed. Practice saying "no" to non-essential commitments. Use this time to protect your study and work hours. Protecting your boundaries will ensure that you don’t feel overwhelmed, helping you stay focused on your primary goals. If it helps, let close friends and family know about your current commitments to avoid misunderstandings when you need time for work or study. Automate Holiday Preparations When Possible Streamline holiday planning by automating tasks like shopping (order online and schedule delivery) and meal planning. Reducing holiday-related “to-dos” saves time and energy for work and study, helping you avoid burnout. Schedule Time for Self-Care Amid the Holiday Hustle Don’t forget to take short breaks to recharge, even if it’s a quick stretch, meditation session or a walk outside. Planning small breaks can help you stay sharp and motivated. Remember – consistent self-care prevents burnout, boosts productivity, and helps you stay balanced as you juggle multiple responsibilities. Reflect and Reset for the New Year Finally, as the year wraps up, take time to assess your progress in school and at work. Set aside time for self-reflection by listing accomplishments this past year that you’re proud of and identifying any adjustments you’d like or areas you want to focus on in the coming year. This intentional pause allows you to celebrate achievements, identify areas for growth, and prepare for a fresh start in January. Balancing graduate school, work and the holidays requires strategic planning and clear priorities, but with a little preparation, you can enjoy the season without sacrificing your goals. By applying these time management strategies, you’ll enter the New Year feeling accomplished—and ready for whatever comes next! Read More. Leveraging online resources for academic success | 10.17.2024 By Laura Woo, Marketing Intern Balancing graduate studies with a demanding professional life can feel like juggling two full-time commitments. Whether you’re pursuing an advanced degree to accelerate your career or to deepen your expertise, leveraging online resources can help you manage your time effectively and maximize your academic success. From productivity tools to specialized research databases, here’s how to utilize digital resources tailored for graduate students who are navigating coursework, career responsibilities, and personal commitments: 1. Take Advantage of University Tools At the University of Illinois, students have access to various online tools like Canvas, Zoom, and specialized platforms that serve as virtual classrooms. Canvas offers features such as instructor feedback, discussion boards, and notifications for deadlines.

Boldly Illinois 2030 Office of the Chancellor Boldly Illinois 2030 Overview The Framework Align and Plan Being Bold Download the Framework Home Collaborate. Include. Empower. Boldly Illinois 2030 Boldly Illinois is a collective opportunity Boldness means being fearless, standing out and doing uncommon things, like reimagining the role of a land-grant university in the 21st century. Boldly Illinois connotes doing this work in a way that reflects the unique values and vision that is the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Boldly Illinois challenges us to think differently, take risks, be courageous enough to fail and transcend business as usual. Wide aerial shot of the tree-lined main quad at the University of Illinois slowly zooming in on Foellinger Auditorium, a domed building with six large pillars It is no ordinary work which we are set to do, and it comes to us under no ordinary circumstances. We are not here to reproduce, in this new locality, some old and well-known style of college or university. The hungry eyes of toiling millions are turned, with mingled hope and fear, upon us, to see what new and better solution we can possibly offer of the great problems on which their well-being and destiny depend. –John Milton Gregory Listen to the John Milton Gregory quote Our Illinois Values We become stronger as we align our activities with the values, mission, vision and goals of the university, allowing us to pursue excellence in a uniquely Illinois way. Building on the success of the previous strategic plan, Boldly Illinois grew out of a process to identify what makes our university a special place. Campus conversations involved thousands of people and included two summits, multiple brainstorming sessions and virtual feedback. Three defining qualities of what we value came into focus through these conversations: Collaboration Collaboration to solve problems and promote understanding Inclusion Authentic inclusion to build community Empowerment Empowerment to enable individuals to be successful We are and aspire to grow as a collaborative, inclusive and empowering community of scholars, educators, students and learners comprised of scientists, artists, leaders, creators, staff and contributors. When we focus our activities on these core values, we amplify the power of our collective impact. We encourage you to explore The Framework and the Align and Plan sections of this website to discover ways to connect these values to your activities. A truly bold university is one that is determined to use its momentum to move fearlessly forward. It is also unafraid to critically and honestly examine its past in order to shape a more strategic and more equitable future for everyone. This university needs to be bold and imaginative in reshaping research and practice by recognizing that our land-grant educational responsibilities to a 21st century society means rethinking some long-held traditional practices at our university. –Chancellor Robert J. Jones Vision & Mission Boldly Illinois builds on the success and momentum of the previous strategic plan by reaffirming the university’s foundational vision and mission, along with our long-standing overarching goals. Vision We will be the pre-eminent public research university with a land-grant mission and global impact. Mission The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is charged by our state to enhance the lives of people in Illinois, across the nation and around the world through our leadership in learning, discovery, engagement and economic development. Goals Foster scholarship, discovery and innovation Scholarship, discovery and innovation are at the heart of Illinois’ local, national and global impact. We will drive new frontiers by attracting and retaining a diverse group of faculty, students and staff endowed with creativity and intellectual depth and breadth. Modern infrastructures, streamlined processes and enriched interdisciplinary and convergent work will advance the university’s mission. Provide transformative learning experiences Illinois will deliver on the fundamental promise of a public university — to teach students and to pioneer the science and the art of learning. We aim to create transformative knowledge — for the individual and, collectively, for the world in which we live and work. Make a significant and visible societal impact When the core foundations of discovery combine with transformative learning and teaching, the outcomes are no longer measured simply in degrees or in citations. They are seen in how the world is changed for the better through contact with the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The university lives up to its land-grant mission in many ways, and we will better organize, enrich and value these contributions as we reach out to our local, regional, national and global communities. Steward current resources and generate additional resources for strategic initiatives The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has stewarded its land-grant mission and accompanying financial, human, technology and infrastructure resources while tackling significant budgetary challenges. We need to continue to refine, coordinate and structure our financial framework to manage all of our resources effectively and develop new lines of revenue to support our human resources, infrastructure, operating budget and strategic initiatives. To create this framework, we must streamline our processes, reduce redundancies and improve the quality and quantity of services throughout campus. Using the Boldly Illinois Framework Being bold requires new ideas and new ways of thinking. As you, your college, department, committee or team begins to identify these ideas and prioritize them, the planning guide, full of templates and other resources, will help you ask insightful questions that will help align your activities with the university’s values and goals.

Take the first step by registering as a Veteran with the Chez Veterans Center. The Chez Veterans Center works to maximize your VA benefits and make the transition to college easier. We offer academic coaching services as well as individual, couples, family, and family counseling. Visit the Chez Website Greetings from the Chez Veterans Center at Illinois! Programs & Services Transition & Academic Services From our own military experience and working with our current Veterans and military-connected students it has become clear that the transition from a military environment to a college or university can be difficult. This is particularly true of Veteran students with a disability. Our transition services will help you set up your VA benefits, find suitable housing, connect you with your program’s academic advisor and more! We also provide individualized academic coaching, tutoring, student veteran orientation course, and disability self-management. We understand that colleges and universities often are not set up to properly meet the needs of non-traditional military-connected students, This is why we work with students to transition and be comfortable at Illinois. Undergraduate Admission If you're a Veteran or military-connected student interested in pursuing an undergraduate degree at UIUC, you can visit this page . Military-connected students include active-duty members, veterans, and dependents of those in the US Military Service Benefits & Outreach Navigating the student-veterans benefit programs can be overwhelming and frustrating. The Chez Veterans Center will partner with you to work with the university and different government agencies to make sure that you receive every veteran benefit you are entitled to. This includes the Post-9/11 GI Bill, the Montgomery GI Bill, the Illinois Veterans Grant, and strategies on how to maximize your benefits each year. Our office will also work with you to better understand any disabilities you may have and ensure that you have the proper accommodations to succeed at Illinois through collaboration with DRES. Peer Mentoring Incoming students are connected with trained Vet Connect mentors who are academically successful students that have been on campus for at least one year. These peers have already experienced what you are now and are trained to guide you through the transition to campus and help you make one of the largest universities in the country feel smaller and more comfortable. Health & Life Skills One of the most significant changes in your transition out of the military is going from an environment filled with structure and routine to one with almost no structure at all. If we aren’t mindful of this transition its possible to fall behind on a number of healthy habits. The Chez Veterans Center provides nutritional counseling, fitness opportunities, mindfulness and yoga exercises. We also have services to assist student veterans with newly acquired injuries and how to physically adapt to life with the injury and understand how this disability may impact their learning and integration to their new lifestyle. Career & Employment Many student Veteran leave the military unsure of the kind of civilian career they want and can go into. The Chez Veterans Center provides services that will help you identify a career path that interests you, understand how to translate your military experience into job skills, connect you with internship and job opportunities, as well as connect students with employers interested in hiring Veteran students. Counseling & Family Lifestyle changes for a student Veterans and military-connected students impact the entire family. The family’s adjustments and transitions need attention as well. We provide individual, couples, family and group counseling to support our military-connected students overall well-being.

The Illinois were actually a confederation of six related tribes and  part of the larger Algonquin tribal group. These explorers set up trading posts  and missions and gave the French spelling “Illinois” to the name Illini. At one  time or another, many different Native American tribes occupied the Illinois  region. Their presence is reflected in many place names throughout the state  such as Kankakee, Kickapoo, Waukegan and Winnetka. French influence is evident  in names such as Des Plaines, Creve Coeur, Joliet and LaSalle. In 1763, the  French were defeated by the British in the French and Indian War. The Illinois  region then became British territory until the time of the American Revolution.  The Iroquois Native Americans gradually drove out the Illini and by 1832  virtually all tribes had been driven out of Illinois. Illinois became the 21st state in 1818 and  Champaign County was established in 1833. Because of the rich land, many  farmers moved to Illinois. The town of Urbana became official in June of 1833  and was the county seat. Champaign County was part of the judicial district  served by the young lawyer, Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln grew up in the village of  New Salem and later lived and worked in the city of Springfield where he is  also buried. Illinois is known as the “Land of Lincoln”. The Illinois Central  Railroad line from Chicago was established in the 1850’s and ran two miles west  of Urbana where the village of West Urbana developed. By 1860 West Urbana had  become the city of Champaign, population 1,727. The 1850s were a time of growth  in Champaign County. During this period, the first doctors arrived, and the  first public school, first newspaper and the first bank were established. The  Champaign Public Library was established in 1866, Urbana Free Library in 1874.  In 1868, 77 students attended classes at the Illinois Industrial University,  which changed its name to the University of Illinois in 1885. Wright Street is  the dividing line between Champaign and Urbana today. Part of the university is  in Champaign and part is in Urbana. Although the cities are physically  connected, they have separate governments, school districts, etc. Nearly two-thirds of the people of Illinois  live in or near Chicago, but the capital city is Springfield. The state tree is  the oak, the state bird is the cardinal and the state flower is the native  violet. The state song is “By Thy Rivers Gently Flowing”. Principal rivers are  the Illinois, the Ohio and the Mississippi. Besides President Abraham Lincoln,  other famous natives of Illinois include the social worker Jane Addams,  President Ronald Reagan, architect Frank Lloyd Wright, writer Ernest Hemingway  and poet Carl Sandburg. Film critic Roger Ebert and Olympic speed skater Bonnie  Blair are natives of Champaign-Urbana. Banking Choosing a Bank There are two basic types of bank accounts: checking  accounts and savings accounts. When you go to open your account, take your  passport and immigration documents with you to serve as identification. Checking Account A checking account  will probably be most suited to your needs. With a checking account you can  deposit your money in the account and access those funds with a debit card or  by writing a personal check. The bank will provide you with a debit card and a  few checks to get you started, any additional checks can be ordered for a fee.  Some checking accounts have a minimum balance requirement. If you go below the  minimum, you will be charged a fee. Be sure to ask about any requirements when  you go to open your account. Savings Account If you have money  that you do not need to use immediately, you may want to open a savings  account. The advantage of a savings account is that money in the account earns  a small amount of interest. You can usually deposit and withdraw money from a  savings account as you wish. As with checking accounts, there is normally a  minimum account balance requirement. If your account balance falls below the  minimum requirement, the bank will deduct a monthly fee from your account. ATMs (Automated  Teller Machines) & Debit Cards A debit card is a  card that can be used to purchase goods and services in stores and online. They  are given with most new checking accounts. They can be used anywhere credit  cards are accepted. Unlike a credit card, however, the funds are immediately  deducted from your account balance when you make a purchase. A debit card  allows you to get cash, make deposits, transfer funds, or check your account  balance at any time of the day or night from a bank ATM machine.Â  You may be charged a fee for using an ATM from  another bank. There are many ATM machines located throughout the  Champaign-Urbana area. Please keep your personal safety in mind when using an  ATM, especially after dark and when on foot. Never give your Personal  Identification Number (PIN) or card information out to anyone. Currency American currency is  based on the decimal system with 100 cents (Â¢) to each dollar ($). Currency is  issued in coins or bills. The names and values of the coins are as follows: Name Value Description Penny Nickel Dime Quarter Half-Dollar Silver    Dollar (1 cent) (5 cents) (10 cents) (25 cents) (50 cents) (100    cents) The only    copper colored coin Larger    than a penny The    smallest coin Larger    than a nickel Larger    than a quarter, rarely used The    largest coin, rarely used Healthcare It is a good idea to establish  contact with a physician and dentist when you arrive here, especially if you  have children. You may wish to ask friends or co-workers to recommend doctors.  Physicians are also listed in the Yellow Pages of the telephone directory under  “Physicians and Surgeons” and on the Internet. There are three major clinics in  this community. Carle Hospital is located at 602 W. University, Urbana. You can  visit them online at carle.org . Presence Covenant Medical Center is located  at 140 W. Park, Urbana. Their website is www.provena.org/covenant. Christie  Clinic is located in several locations throughout Champaign-Urbana.Â  Their website is https://christieclinic.com/ .Â  There  are a large number of general and specialty doctors at each clinic. Your  particular medical insurance may limit your choice of doctors, so it is  important to check with them before making an appointment. It is important to be on time for doctor’s  appointments. However, you may experience a long wait to see the doctor. You  may ask the doctor’s receptionist how much the charge will be. On your first  visit to a new doctor, you may have to pay at the time of the visit instead of  being mailed a bill. Take your health insurance papers with you to the doctor’s  office. Children Schools require a physical examination before a child enters the school  system. You will receive proper forms for this when you register your child for  school. It is important for healthy children to have regular physical check-ups  and immunizations against illnesses. Whenever your child is sick, telephone  your doctor’s office for advice or to make an appointment. The doctor or nurse  can answer many of your questions over the telephone. Maternity Care There are  obstetriciansâspecialists in pregnancy careâand general practitioners who begin  caring for women as soon as they learn of their pregnancy. There are several  female doctors in this area who care for pregnant women. If you are  uncomfortable with a male doctor, you may ask that a female nurse be present  during examinations. Many hospitals in the area offer classes for expectant  parents. Ask your doctor about these programs. Please Note: not all health  insurance plans cover pregnancy/birth costs. Please double check this  information with your insurance company. Emergencies For injury or illness that needs immediate attention, visit the  Emergency Room of a local hospital.Â   Emergency Rooms are open all day and night.Â  Call 911 if you need assistance from the  police, fire department, or ambulance transportation.

For example, the number at ISSS is (217) 333-1303: 217  (area code), 333 (local exchange), 8225 (subscriber number). Long Distance Calls Within Your Area Code When calling another city within  your area code, you just dial the seven-digit number. Another way to know which  “exchanges” in your area code are considered local is to check a local phone  book. A list of local exchanges appears in every phone book. Particularly with  land-line phones, non-local calls are more expensive than local calls, even if  they are within the same area code. Outside Your Area Code The U.S. is divided into many small regions or areas, each reached by an  area code that must be dialed when calling from outside that particular “area”.  When dialing a telephone number outside your area code, dial a “1” followed by  the three digit “area code”. Plus the seven-digit local phone number. For  example, if you were in Virginia and needed to call ISSS you would dial:  1-217-333-1303 English Language & Community Education Programs If you are interested in practicing or  improving your English language skills, please visit our English Language page for more  information.

The State of Illinois is located in the Central Standard Time Zone, often  abbreviated to CST.Â  When moving from  East to West, subtract 1 hour for each time zone.Â  For example, if it is 2:00 pm in Virginia  (Eastern Time Zone), it is 1:00 pm in Champaign, Illinois (Central Standard  Time). When viewing times, especially for national  events, it is important to note the time zone abbreviation, and calculate the  appropriate time based on your current time zone. Being On Time To some, the United States is considered a  very time-conscious culture.Â  Many people  think it is important to be “on time” for meetings, appointments, and even  social events.Â  People often create a  schedule of their daily meetings and appointments, and aim to arrive a few  minutes before each one.Â  Allowing enough  time for transportation between meetings is also something to take into consideration. Local Businesses Types of Stores Supermarkets  (grocery  stores) These are large stores where you can buy almost any food (meats,  vegetables, fruit, baked good, milk, cheese), cleaning supplies, paper goods,  toothpaste, shampoo, etc. They are frequently combined with a drugstore and  therefore have a pharmacy.

This day is the last holiday of the summer season  and is celebrated with picnics and other outings. Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur (3 days in September and October): The  holidays of Rosh Hashanah (New Year) and Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement) and the  ten-day interval between them comprise the most sacred period in the Jewish  calendar. This period, known as the High Holy Days, combines the welcoming of  the New Year with reflective examination of one’s life during the past year.  Rosh Hashanah is characterized by family feasts and sending New Year’s  greetings. Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish year, is a time of fasting  and prayer. Columbus Day (Second Monday in October): Columbus reached  the West Indies in 1492, and is popularly referred to as the explorer who  “discovered” America, although the continent was already populated by Native  Americans and had been visited by earlier seafarers. Americans observe the  holiday with parades and festivals. In the Northeast, the long weekend is the  high point of the season for viewing the brilliantly colored fall leaves. Halloween (October 31): This was originally a religious  holiday-the day before All Soul’s Day--but its religious character has been  lost in the U.S. and it is now celebrated mostly as a children’s day.  Traditions include carving out pumpkins with funny faces as well as dressing in  costumes and going around the neighborhood to receive treats of candy, fruit,  and cookies. When they knock on the door, children say “trick or treat”. Adults  often use the occasion for costume parties. Colors of the holiday are orange  and black and symbols include witches, ghosts, broomsticks and black cats. Veterans Day (November 11): Originally established to  commemorate Armistice Day of the First World War, the holiday was changed after  World War II to serve as an occasion to pay tribute to veterans of all wars. It  is marked by parades, speeches, and the laying of wreaths at military  cemeteries and war memorials. Thanksgiving Day (Fourth Thursday in November): In 1621 the  pilgrims of Plymouth colony in Massachusetts prepared a feast that they shared  with some Native Americans to give thanks for the bountiful harvest and their  survival over the wilderness. It was made an official holiday in 1863.  Americans give thanks for the good life they enjoy by getting together with  family and friends to eat traditional food such as turkey, cranberry sauce, sweet  potatoes and pumpkin pie. Hanukkah (late November or early December): An  eight-day Jewish holiday marking the rededication of the Temple. The “Festival  of Lights” is celebrated by exchanging gifts and lighting the candles of the  menorah. Christmas Day (December 25): Although religious in origin  (commemorating the birth of Christ), Christmas is a holiday celebrated either  in a secular or religious way by most everyone in the country. Family members  travel great distances to be together for this day on which gifts are exchanged  and a traditional dinner is shared. Many houses are decorated with Christmas  trees, lights, candles and wreaths, and Santa Claus brings gifts for children. Kwanzaa (Seven days beginning December 26): An  African-American holiday adapted from the traditional African “harvest of first  crops”. It is highlighted by exchanging gifts, feasting, lighting candles and  discussing special topics. New Year’s Eve (December 31): People gather with friends and  family for parties to “ring out the old and ring in the new” an expression that  reflects the old custom of ringing church bells to greet the New Year.

Beyond being wrapped around histones as irregular groups of “beads on a string”, chromatin is organized into topologically associated domains, which are composed of small and large loops, and form euchromatic and heterochromatic compartments. In this talk, I will present biophysical principles we are uncovering about genome organization across three different scales, including sequence-dependent DNA mechanics, chromatin loops for homology search, and polyamines' role in translating nucleosome condensability into 3D genome organization.

Boldly Illinois 2030 Office of the Chancellor Boldly Illinois 2030 Overview The Framework Align and Plan Being Bold Download the Framework Home Collaborate. Include. Empower. Boldly Illinois 2030 Boldly Illinois is a collective opportunity Boldness means being fearless, standing out and doing uncommon things, like reimagining the role of a land-grant university in the 21st century. Boldly Illinois connotes doing this work in a way that reflects the unique values and vision that is the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Boldly Illinois challenges us to think differently, take risks, be courageous enough to fail and transcend business as usual. Wide aerial shot of the tree-lined main quad at the University of Illinois slowly zooming in on Foellinger Auditorium, a domed building with six large pillars It is no ordinary work which we are set to do, and it comes to us under no ordinary circumstances. We are not here to reproduce, in this new locality, some old and well-known style of college or university. The hungry eyes of toiling millions are turned, with mingled hope and fear, upon us, to see what new and better solution we can possibly offer of the great problems on which their well-being and destiny depend. –John Milton Gregory Listen to the John Milton Gregory quote Our Illinois Values We become stronger as we align our activities with the values, mission, vision and goals of the university, allowing us to pursue excellence in a uniquely Illinois way. Building on the success of the previous strategic plan, Boldly Illinois grew out of a process to identify what makes our university a special place. Campus conversations involved thousands of people and included two summits, multiple brainstorming sessions and virtual feedback. Three defining qualities of what we value came into focus through these conversations: Collaboration Collaboration to solve problems and promote understanding Inclusion Authentic inclusion to build community Empowerment Empowerment to enable individuals to be successful We are and aspire to grow as a collaborative, inclusive and empowering community of scholars, educators, students and learners comprised of scientists, artists, leaders, creators, staff and contributors. When we focus our activities on these core values, we amplify the power of our collective impact. We encourage you to explore The Framework and the Align and Plan sections of this website to discover ways to connect these values to your activities. A truly bold university is one that is determined to use its momentum to move fearlessly forward. It is also unafraid to critically and honestly examine its past in order to shape a more strategic and more equitable future for everyone. This university needs to be bold and imaginative in reshaping research and practice by recognizing that our land-grant educational responsibilities to a 21st century society means rethinking some long-held traditional practices at our university. –Chancellor Robert J. Jones Vision & Mission Boldly Illinois builds on the success and momentum of the previous strategic plan by reaffirming the university’s foundational vision and mission, along with our long-standing overarching goals. Vision We will be the pre-eminent public research university with a land-grant mission and global impact. Mission The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is charged by our state to enhance the lives of people in Illinois, across the nation and around the world through our leadership in learning, discovery, engagement and economic development. Goals Foster scholarship, discovery and innovation Scholarship, discovery and innovation are at the heart of Illinois’ local, national and global impact. We will drive new frontiers by attracting and retaining a diverse group of faculty, students and staff endowed with creativity and intellectual depth and breadth. Modern infrastructures, streamlined processes and enriched interdisciplinary and convergent work will advance the university’s mission. Provide transformative learning experiences Illinois will deliver on the fundamental promise of a public university — to teach students and to pioneer the science and the art of learning. We aim to create transformative knowledge — for the individual and, collectively, for the world in which we live and work. Make a significant and visible societal impact When the core foundations of discovery combine with transformative learning and teaching, the outcomes are no longer measured simply in degrees or in citations. They are seen in how the world is changed for the better through contact with the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The university lives up to its land-grant mission in many ways, and we will better organize, enrich and value these contributions as we reach out to our local, regional, national and global communities. Steward current resources and generate additional resources for strategic initiatives The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has stewarded its land-grant mission and accompanying financial, human, technology and infrastructure resources while tackling significant budgetary challenges. We need to continue to refine, coordinate and structure our financial framework to manage all of our resources effectively and develop new lines of revenue to support our human resources, infrastructure, operating budget and strategic initiatives. To create this framework, we must streamline our processes, reduce redundancies and improve the quality and quantity of services throughout campus. Using the Boldly Illinois Framework Being bold requires new ideas and new ways of thinking. As you, your college, department, committee or team begins to identify these ideas and prioritize them, the planning guide, full of templates and other resources, will help you ask insightful questions that will help align your activities with the university’s values and goals.

Land Acknowledgement Statement – Office of the Chancellor Office of the Chancellor Search About Administrative Officers Staff Committees Annual Report Radical Collaborations Excellence at Scale Exceptional Faculty Community Focus Discovery and Innovation Bold Vision Resources Campus Strategic Plan Commission on Native Imagery Report Joint Statement on Anti-Semitism Campus Master Plan The Illinois Promise Illinois Commitment Land Acknowledgement Statement Land Acknowledgement Statement July 26, 2018 A Land Acknowledgement is a formal statement that recognizes and respects Native peoples as traditional guardians of lands and the enduring relationship that exists between Native peoples and their traditional territories. The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign recognizes the land acknowledgement statement is an expression of gratitude and appreciation to those on whose territory we reside, and a way of honoring the Native peoples who have been living and working on the land from time immemorial. The Acknowledgement is shared at events such as graduation, convocation, and critical conversations. However, University faculty, staff and student organizations are welcome to use the suggested language at their events. Objective: The objective of these guidelines is to establish recommendations for University of Illinois employees and student organizations about appropriate and consistent recognition and acknowledgement of Native peoples as the traditional guardians of the lands on which the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is situated. Scope: The Land Acknowledgement Statement can be performed by anyone and is a respectful public acknowledgement of the traditional guardians of the land. Most often, an Acknowledgement will be performed by the host or master of ceremonies of the event or gathering, unless a specific person has been requested to share the Acknowledgement. Events where it is appropriate for the Land Acknowledgement Statement to be shared include: Graduation Annual Freshmen Convocation; and Critical Conversations. An optional Acknowledgement, suggested by Native American House, can be used at the discretion of the event organizers. Events where it is appropriate to share the optional Land Acknowledgement Statement include: Small formal meetings; Symposia, forums, discussion panels, or workshops, and Small events or receptions. Considerations: Regardless of the length of the Acknowledgement, the Acknowledgement is read aloud as the first order of business or at the opening of an event by the first speaker or host. For live reading of the statement, please see the text and pronounciation guide below. A recorded version (narrator voice over beautiful footage of campus, either with or without a music bed) is available for download here. Land Acknowledgement Statement (for on-campus events) As a land-grant institution, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has a responsibility to acknowledge the historical context in which it exists. In order to remind ourselves and our community, we will begin this event with the following statement. We are currently on the lands of the Peoria, Kaskaskia, Piankashaw, Wea, Miami, Mascoutin, Odawa, Sauk, Mesquaki, Kickapoo, Potawatomi, Ojibwe, and Chickasaw Nations. It is necessary for us to acknowledge these Native Nations and for us to work with them as we move forward as an institution. Over the next 150 years, we will be a vibrant community inclusive of all our differences, with Native peoples at the core of our efforts. Optional Land Acknowledgement Statement suggested by Native American House (for on-campus events) I/We would like to begin today by recognizing and acknowledging that we are on the lands of the Peoria, Kaskaskia, Piankashaw, Wea, Miami, Mascoutin, Odawa, Sauk, Mesquaki, Kickapoo, Potawatomi, Ojibwe, and Chickasaw Nations. These lands were the traditional territory of these Native Nations prior to their forced removal; these lands continue to carry the stories of these Nations and their struggles for survival and identity. As a land-grant institution, the University of Illinois has a particular responsibility to acknowledge the peoples of these lands, as well as the histories of dispossession that have allowed for the growth of this institution for the past 150 years. We are also obligated to reflect on and actively address these histories and the role that this university has played in shaping them. This acknowledgement and the centering of Native peoples is a start as we move forward for the next 150 years. Land Acknowledgement Statement (for off-campus events) As a land-grant institution, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has a responsibility to acknowledge the historical context in which it exists. In order to remind ourselves and our community, we will begin this event with the following statement. The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign sits on the lands of the Peoria, Kaskaskia, Piankashaw, Wea, Miami, Mascoutin, Odawa, Sauk, Mesquaki, Kickapoo, Potawatomi, Ojibwe, and Chickasaw Nations. It is necessary for us to acknowledge these Native Nations and for us to work with them as we move forward as an institution.
